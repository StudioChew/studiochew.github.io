        <h1>bought some games - 2020-11-28</h1>
        <p>
        hey everyone once again on the same day, so yesterday on black friday i bought a few
        games for my nintendo switch. i'm going to be talking about them here. i bought:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Mom Hid My Game!</li>
            <li>PIXBOY</li>
            <li>Picklock</li>
            <li>VOSARIA: Lair of the Forgotten</li>
            <li>They Came From The Sky</li>
            <li>Kero Blaster</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
        so, lets start the rating thing.
        </p>
        <h2>Mom Hid My Game!</h2>
        <p>
        this is an interesting one. the art style of the game reminds me of the old nintendo
        wii and ds manual art. the ending of this game is certainly an interesting one. i
        won't reveal it here, just in case you want to buy the game.
        </p>
        <p>
        the game has 50 games, of which a few where actually challenging and i had to use
        the built-in hints system, which was cool because it doesn't just give you the
        hints, you first get a card game where you have 8 cards. some of the cards have
        bad things and some have hints. you have to match 2 of the good cards. it doesn't
        just end there though, because if you match 2 of the bad cards, as far as i know,
        it makes you lose the game, so there is risks involved.
        </p>
        <p>
        the game is a solid 6/10. short and sweet but too big of a price.
        </p>
        <h2>PIXBOY</h2>
        <p>
        right off the bat theres an interesting gimmick, which is that you can change the
        colors because there are only 2 colors displayed, its hard to explain.
        although i havent played the game that much and have only reached the second level,
        i don't know if it's that good but i can already tell that if it doesn't start to
        show something for itself it's going to have been too expensive. in that case, 4/10
        but as i said, i haven't played through the game yet.
        </p>
        <h2>Picklock</h2>
        <p>got too boring too fast havent played to end yet because of how boring it was
        4/10 too expensive and boring next game
        </p>
        <h2>VOSARIA: Lair of the Forgotten</h2>
        <p>
        it sounds very interesting and looks very interesting but the game's difficulty is
        very high, atleast for me. or i'm just dumb, who knows. probably a 8/10 not sure
        </p>
        <h2>They Came From The Sky</h2>
        <p>
        you know what's the weirdest part about this game? it's the fact that the age rating
        is 16+, when it doesn't even show a single drop of blood.
        the gameplay is simple, and it's an arcade style game where you play as an ufo and
        you try to get as many humans as possible, and i quote from the eshop description,
        "make a human smoothie". i haven't seen a human smoothie in the game yet. 5/10
        </p>
        <h2>Kero Blaster</h2>
        <p>the most expensive game on the list, but it's definitely worth it. made by the
        same person who made <a href="https://cavestory.org">cave story</a>, one of my all
        time favorite games, i knew it was going to be good. controls are a bit clunky, but
        you get used to it. haven't played through it yet, but i strongly recommend it to
        any fan of pixel's other works. 9/10
        </p>
        <p>and that's the end of the list. thanks for read</p>

        <h1>the font i use - 2020-11-28 </h1>
        <p>
        hello everyone. a few days ago i heard about a font called
        <a href="https://github.com/slavfox/Cozette">cozette</a> and i fell in love. as
        a fan of <a href="https://nerdfonts.com">nerd fonts</a>, it was nice to see an
        alternative, especially when its for bitmap.
        </p>
        <p>
        to install the font, you can install the .otb/.ttf or install it through the aur,
        which is what i did. to do that with the yay aur helper, simply just do this:
        <code>yay -S cozette-otb</code> it is a <b>very</b> cozy font for development and
        general use. if you install it, you might notice that this website might look a bit
        different. why? because i actually use cozette as my website font! being a bitmap
        font, it will use monospace for headings. it uses monospace when you don't have the
        cozette font installed, too. here's a pic (open it in your browser as it is very
        small otherwise):
