<p>why do people keep saying stuff like "aesthetic" and its plural form with no context at all? people like you have ruined the definition of the word. aesthetic is basically another word for "beautiful". aesthetic does not mean some "emo dark depressed vhs" visuals. it means beautiful. so, please, do not mix up words and their definitions.</p>

<p>I'd just like to interject for a moment. What you're refering to as Linux, is in fact, GNU/Linux, or as I've recently taken to calling it, GNU plus Linux. Linux is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning GNU system made useful by the GNU corelibs, shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full OS as defined by POSIX. any computer users run a modified version of the GNU system every day, without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of GNU which is widely used today is often called Linux, and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the GNU system, developed by the GNU Project. There really is a Linux, and these people are using it, but it is just a part of the system they use. Linux is the kernel: the program in the system that allocates the machine's resources to the other programs that you run. The kernel is an essential part of an operating system, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete operating system. Linux is normally used in combination with the GNU operating system: the whole system is basically GNU with Linux added, or GNU/Linux. All the so-called Linux distributions are really distributions of GNU/Linux!</p>

<p>Little operating system talk here, please. I am using an operating system called Windows 10, and believe that any other operating system, including Windows 8.1, 8, 7, Vista, XP, 2000, ME, 98, 95, 3.0, 2.0, 1.0, GNU/Linux Manjaro, Arch, Gentoo, Void, Ubuntu, Mint, Elementary OS, Zorin OS, Peppermint OS, MX Linux, Linux from Scratch, Funtoo, Slackware, Debian, Fedora, Redhat, openSUSE, CentOS, theShell OS, FreeBSD, and many more are absolutely INFERIOR to Windows 10's compelling design and user friendliness. I have never had any problems with Windows 10, except the occasional bluescreen of death, which is, mind you, VERY uncommon. (happens to me only ONCE!! a week!) Microsoft Windows 10 operating system also has MANY customization options, which help you make the operating system perfect for your needs. You can: 1, change the taskbar location. 2, change your desktop background. 3, change the color. These should already be enough to get you all to switch to Windows 10. Also, Windows 10 has EXCELLENT Virus protection. I have used it for as long as Windows 10 has existed, and I have gotten only 6,319 viruses! Look at that small number! I have never used any other operating system, but because such a small amount of people use other operating systems, and anyone can contribute, so scary internet people can ADD HACKS TO YOUR OPERATING SYSTEM! Also, running ANY COMMAND in the terminal has a 1 in 100 chance of DELETING YOUR C: DRIVE IN GNU/LINUX AND MAC!! So, I hope I got you to switch to Windows 10. Goodnight.</p>
